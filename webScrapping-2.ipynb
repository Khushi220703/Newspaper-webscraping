      "Content: Tories to pledge further 2p National Insurance cut in manifesto\n",
      "\n",
      "49 minutes ago By Sam Francis , Political Reporter • Francesca Gillett , BBC News Share\n",
      "\n",
      "PA Rishi Sunak will be in the East Midlands later\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conservatives are launching their election manifesto later, with a promise to cut a further 2p from National Insurance if re-elected. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak claimed the Tories were the party of \"sound money\", and that another Tory government would help working people \"keep more of the money you earn\". He said Labour would instead do \"what socialists always do - take more of your money\". Labour have described the Tories’ ideas as \"the most expensive panic attack in history\". The Conservatives are the second major party to launch their manifesto - which outlines what a party plans to do if it wins power - after the Liberal Democrats on Monday. Later this week will also see manifesto launches from the Green Party and Labour. The Tories have not given the full contents of the manifesto - but Mr Sunak told the BBC yesterday it will include tax cuts, and his policies will be \"fully funded and costed\". \"We're going to keep cutting people's taxes,\" Mr Sunak told the BBC's Nick Robinson. NI is an earnings tax paid by both employee and the company they work for, and the profits of self-employed workers. It is understood another 2p cut in the rate for employees will be in the manifesto - as well as the bigger aim to scrap the tax entirely when it is \"financially responsible\" to do so. The government already cut NI for employees twice in 2024, taking it first from 12% to 10%, and then 10% to 8%. This would be the third rate cut overseen by Mr Sunak, reducing the employee rate to 6p.\n",
      "\n",
      "Watch: Sunak says Conservatives will cut tax if they win\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as the NI cut, the manifesto will also include pledges for homebuyers, after Mr Sunak admitted to the BBC yesterday it “has got harder” for people to have their own home under Conservative governments. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Sunak said the Conservatives would \"launch a brand new and improved Help to Buy scheme to help a new generation on to the property ladder\". Some potential manifesto pledges have already been floated by the Tories, including a pledge at the weekend to scrap stamp duty for first-time buyers of properties costing up to £425,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having own home has become harder under the Conservative government, Rishi Sunak agrees\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Sunak will launch the manifesto after a bruising few days on the campaign trial where he was forced to address questions over whether he would resign after leaving D-Day commemorations early. With Labour leading in the polls and Reform UK targeting Tory voters, Mr Sunak is hoping the manifesto will provide a boost to his party's prospects. Ahead of the launch - happening in the East Midlands - Mr Sunak said the Conservatives have a plan to ensure \"financial security.\" He acknowledged the party had to take \"difficult decisions\" because of the pandemic, but was \"now cutting taxes for earners, parents and pensioners\". Mr Sunak argued that in contrast to Labour the Tories are the party of \"sound money\", invoking the legacy of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher and her chancellor Nigel Lawson. \"In this party, we believe that it is morally right that those who can work do work, and that hard work is rewarded with people being able to keep more of their own money. We will ensure that we have lower welfare so we can lower taxes.” Mr Sunak has frequently invoked Baroness Thatcher and their similar middle-class, small-business parentage, telling the 2023 Conservative conference they were the “the party of the grocer’s daughter and the pharmacist’s son”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conservatives have separately promised not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT - but alongside Labour will keep income tax thresholds frozen until 2028 if they win, meaning taxes will go up for many as their wages rise. The party has also promised to increase the income tax personal allowance for pensioners, giving them a tax cut worth around to £275 by 2030.\n",

      "\n",
      "Labour have promised to create 100,000 extra dental appointments for children, in a bid to clear backlogs in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new appointments will be for urgent and emergency care and on evenings and weekends, according to Labour's plan if they win the general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access to an NHS dentist has become increasingly difficult in many areas - with tooth decay the most common reason children aged five to nine are admitted to hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conservatives have their own \"dental recovery plan\", which was launched earlier this year and offers dentists cash incentives to take on extra NHS patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour's plans, announced on Tuesday, also include a plan to introduce supervised brushing for children, double the number of NHS scanners and reform dentists' contracts to boost numbers where they are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The £109m pledge will be paid for by tightening up non-dom tax rules and clamping down on tax avoidance, Labour said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data published in February showed thousands of children and teenagers were being admitted to hospital for tooth decay treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were nearly 48,000 tooth extractions in NHS hospitals in England for patients aged up to 9 carried out in 2023. Two thirds of these were because of a primary diagnosis of tooth decay - up 17% from the previous 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Childhood tooth extractions cost NHS hospitals £64.3m last year, with decay-related extractions making up £40.7m of this.\n",

      "Content: UN Security Council backs US Israel-Gaza ceasefire plan\n",
      "\n",
      "Just hours before the UN vote, Mr Blinken said his message to leaders in the region was: \"If you want a ceasefire, press Hamas to say, yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The vote is likely to increase pressure on both sides to respond positively to the plan with a view to ending the conflict. It also came shortly after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with foreign leaders , including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an attempt to build support for the peace deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It means the Security Council joins a number of governments, as well as the G7 group of the world's richest nations, in backing the three-part plan that was unveiled by President Joe Biden on 31 May.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resolution states that Israel has accepted the ceasefire proposal, and urges Hamas to agree to it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourteen of the 15 Security Council members voted in favour of the US-drafted resolution. Russia abstained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposal sets out conditions for a \"full and complete ceasefire\", the release of hostages held by Hamas, the return of dead hostages' remains and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners.\n",
      "\n",
      "The group has previously said it supports parts of the plan, and it released a statement on Monday “welcoming” the Security Council resolution. Hamas is likely to demand guarantees the plan would lead to a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its political leadership in Doha has yet to formally respond to the proposal, according to US and Israeli officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposal would end with a major reconstruction plan for Gaza, which has been largely destroyed in the conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first phase concerns a hostage-prisoner swap as well as a short-term ceasefire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second phase includes a \"permanent end to hostilities\", as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to a text of the US draft resolution.\n",
      "\n",

      "An initial post-mortem examination on the body of Dr Michael Mosley has concluded he died of natural causes, the BBC has been told. The TV presenter's remains were found in a rocky area on the Greek island of Symi on Sunday - four days after he went missing while on holiday. Greek police spokeswoman Konstantia Dimoglidou told the BBC that the initial post-mortem found no injuries on his body that could have caused his death. Dr Mosley's time of death was around 16:00 (14:00 BST) on Wednesday, the day he went missing. The 67-year-old father-of-four was reported missing after he set off for a walk from Agios Nikolaos beach - near where he was staying on the northeast side of the island - at about 13:30 local time (11:30 BST) on Wednesday. Dr Mosley's wife, Dr Clare Bailey Mosley, raised the alarm when her husband did not return.\n",

      "Greek authorities conducted an extensive search for Dr Mosley amid high temperatures, deploying police officers, firefighters, divers and a helicopter. The manager of a bar on Agia Marina beach - northwards along the coast from Dr Mosley's starting point - found his body after the island's mayor \"saw something\" by the fence of the bar and alerted staff, PA news agency reported. Police said the initial conclusion that Dr Mosley died of natural causes was based on the position his body was found in, as well as a lack of injuries. Separate toxicology and histology reports have now been ordered. The BBC has seen CCTV footage, taken near the Agia Marina beach bar, that appears to show Dr Mosley disappear from view as he slowly makes his way down a hillside close to where his body was later found. He then collapses out of view behind a wall. Dr Bailey Mosley said on Sunday that her family was \"taking comfort in the fact\" that her husband \"so very nearly made it\" to safety. \"He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn’t be easily seen by the extensive search team,\" she said in a statement.\n",

He gave me the idea that I wasn't broken,\" Mr Watson, who said in 2018 that he had \"reversed\" his type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n",

      "Dr Mosley studied medicine in London and qualified as a doctor, and for the last two decades was working as a presenter, documentary maker, journalist and author. He was known for his TV programmes including Trust Me, I'm a Doctor, and BBC Radio 4's Just One Thing podcast. He also wrote a column for the Daily Mail. Mr Mosley had been an advocate for intermittent fasting diets, including through the 5:2 diet and The Fast 800 diet. Dr Saleyha Ahsan, who co-presented Trust Me, I’m a Doctor with Dr Mosley, told the BBC's Breakfast programme she was initially \"terrified\" to take on the role but that he \"put me at ease almost immediately\".

Shawn Seesahai, 19, died in November last year after being set upon in an unprovoked attack on Stowlawn playing fields in East Park, Wolverhampton. The pair, who cannot be named, are believed to be the youngest convicted of the crime since James Bulger's killers were detained in 1993. During a trial at Nottingham Crown Court, the boys sought to blame each other, but the jury convicted them both of Mr Seesahai's murder on Monday.\n",

One defendant had previously pleaded guilty to possessing a machete \"without good reason or lawful authority\", while his co-defendant was convicted of the same charge on Monday. Mr Seesahai was from Anguilla in the Caribbean, but had travelled to the UK to get help with his eyesight and lived in Handsworth, Birmingham. The teenager had cataracts that he had been unable to get treatment for in Anguilla, and after successful surgery in the UK, was able to start planning for the future and think about getting an education, prosecutor Michelle Heeley KC said. It is what it is - boys, 12, Snapchat after murder In an interview released after the verdicts, Mr Seesahai's parents Suresh and Maneshwary said they would never be able to get over the loss of their son, who they described as a \"very loving child\". Special arrangements were made in court given the boys' ages.

      "On 13 November, Mr Seesahai travelled to Wolverhampton with friends, while the two defendants were together on the same afternoon, meeting two girls about the same age. The court heard one of the boys regularly carried a machete, and had been passing it between him and his co-accused that day. Mr Seesahai and a friend went to the playing fields and sat on a bench before walking around the park and later returning to the bench where they encountered the boys and a girl. The pair “came together” with the defendants, the court heard, with one boy \"deliberately shoulder-brushing\" Mr Seesahai. When he questioned what they were doing, one pulled a machete from his trousers and Mr Seesahai shouted “run” to his friend. His friend fled and as he looked back he saw Mr Seesahai on the ground, surrounded by the boys, the court heard. Mr Seesahai was struck with the machete to his back, legs and skull and also beaten. He was hit so hard on the skull with the weapon that a \"piece of bone had actually come away”, jurors were told. \"He had slash wounds on his leg, and most significantly he had an injury from the machete that went through his body all the way from his back, through his ribs and into his heart,” Ms Heeley told the court.\n",

Although CPR was administered to him, he died at the scene at about 21:00 GMT. The court heard the boys had screenshots of knives like the one used on their phones and had searched online for news articles about the attack. One boy had also searched online for \"how many criminal records can you have to leave the country” a day after the murder on 14 November. One had posed in a mask with the murder weapon for a picture hours before the killing, and was found to have 11 areas of bloodstaining on his clothing.

He always said 'mum. I'll be shining, I'll be shining, don't worry I will help you'.\" Mr Seesahai said he felt sorry for the parents of the two killers and did not wish to see them \"go away for life\", but he wanted to see the \"right sentence\".

He said they showed Essex had “a continually changing landscape”. The unearthed pottery, which can be linked to regions in France, meant Essex was likely to have been involved in international trade. “We forget how much trade there was across the North Sea,” said Mr Haines. “On the Essex coast, you’ve got all of these little estuaries so people would be trading from the continent up and down them - it’s a very dynamic, very international landscape.”\n",

When complete, it will carry 20 million litres of pressurised water every day, which the water company said would improve the resilience of supply for 370,000 customers. It is scheduled to be complete by autumn 2024. Mr Wilson said information about the discoveries would be made publicly available.

      "BBC Peter and Rebecca say it is \"almost impossible\" to buy a house while renting at the same time\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Felix paints and decorates other people’s homes for a living, but he says it is frustrating that he cannot afford one of his own. He and his partner, Rebecca Wilson, are in their early 40s. They have been renting together for nearly three years, and are losing hope of ever owning a house. Peter is among the many people who got in touch with the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote to tell us that housing is the most important issue for them during this election. Peter and Rebecca, who works in car insurance, each earn about £30,000 a year before tax, and rent a three-bedroom house in south-west Birmingham. Their rent is £950 a month without bills and has risen twice in the past 18 months. Like many people around the UK, they are desperate to buy their own house, but are struggling to save enough for a deposit. “To buy a house and rent at the same time is almost impossible,” says Rebecca. They are beginning to wonder whether they should give up, or whether the politicians can promise them any help. It would win their votes, they say. Housing policy has never been more important in an election. While the cost-of-living squeeze from rising energy and food costs has started to ease, there is no such luck with housing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images The cost of housing is a big issue for many voters\n",
      "\n",
      "House prices rose more steeply than usual during the pandemic and then plateaued, even falling in some parts of the country. But the latest signs are that they are going up again. Rents have been climbing steeply since early 2021 and are still rising – up 6.2% in the past year. And mortgages are also more expensive. Borrowing rates started to rise in early 2022. An average two-year fixed rate mortgage was then just over 2%; it is currently just under 6%, making monthly payments more than double what they would have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last few elections politicians have made big claims on housing, ranging from a promise of mass right-to-buy from housing associations to punchy housebuilding targets. But they rarely delivered. A 300,000-a-year target for housebuilding has been missed. The pandemic, energy crisis, and interest rate hikes are factors, of course, but so is policy. The UK has the highest housing costs in the English-speaking world. On average more than a quarter of disposable income is spent on housing. And the grubby truth is that when the cost of housing increases, whoever is in power tends to benefit. That is because voters who own houses feel like they are getting richer. So there is little incentive for governments to dampen house price rises by making sure more are built, and a massive incentive to support buyers instead, through things like mortgage subsidies and stamp duty cuts – in effect subsidising demand. That has been the policy pattern that has delivered relentless increases in housing costs. On top of that there is planning. Up and down the land, most Tuesdays and Wednesdays, councillors sitting on planning committees reject local housebuilding projects because that is largely what their voters want.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Grasp the nettle'\n",
      "\n",
      "Without some kind of action, there is a very real chance the difficulties facing would-be homeowners and renters could get worse. The Home Builders Federation (HBF) has released figures showing that planning approvals have “continued to plummet”. Approvals for units – that is new homes - fell by 13% in the year to April, on top of sharp falls the previous year. Approvals for sites to be built on are running at levels even lower than in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The HBF’s executive chairman, Stewart Baseley, says the figures illustrate the “stark challenge” ahead and that the next government will need to “grasp the nettle and be bold and brave” to tackle the barriers to supplying housing, the planning system, and support for buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rebecca and Peter are currently paying nearly £1,000 a month rent for their three-bedroom house\n",
      "\n",
      "That kind of intervention would be music to the ears of Peter and Rebecca. In Birmingham, where they are looking to buy, rents have been rising but house prices have fallen slightly, by 1.5% over the past year, according to the ONS, so they feel it might be possible. They are looking for a three-bedroom house, so that Peter’s son from a previous relationship can have his own room when he stays over. While Rebecca has never owned a property, Peter did have shared ownership in a flat before the 2008 financial crash. Back then he managed to keep up with his mortgage payments and is confident they would manage now. “If I did it when I was 25, then I can definitely do it now - especially when there are two incomes,” he says. But they have calculated that at their current rate of saving - £100 a month each - it would take them five years to save enough for a deposit. In the meantime they fear rents could go up again, other costs may increase, and house prices may rise so that their dream remains out of reach. It can feel like you are fighting a losing battle, says Rebecca. “You save and save and save and it's just never going to be enough,” says Peter.\n",

      "What are the parties promising?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conservatives would build homes, prioritising brownfield development. They would permanently waive stamp duty tax for first-time buyers of properties costing up to £425,000. This threshold was raised temporarily and is due to revert to £300,000 in March 2025. Labour would reform planning rules, fast-forward development on brownfield and what it calls “grey belt” land such as car parks. It wants to extend an existing scheme, which helps people get a mortgage with a smaller deposit and is backing more rights for renters. The Liberal Democrats want additional social housing and new “garden cities”. They support local authorities that want to end the \"right to buy\" policy for council housing, ban no-fault evictions, make three-year tenancies the default, and create a national register of licensed landlords. The Green Party would invest in new social housing and bring empty properties back into use. They would set higher environmental standards for new builds and would require more affordable units. They support rent controls and an eviction ban. The Scottish National Party has declared a national housing emergency and is promising funding for new affordable homes across Scotland, including for rural and islands projects. Plaid Cymru would expand social housing and support the Welsh construction industry. The party would allow local authorities to buy back more second homes and holiday lets. They want a ban on no-fault evictions and rent controls. Reform would fast-track planning, offer tax incentives for development on brownfield sites and give tax breaks to small-scale landlords. People born in the UK would be given priority for social housing.\n",

      "The Liberal Democrats have launched their 2024 election manifesto, called For A Fair Deal. The document sets out the policies that the party plans to introduce should it win the election. Here are 11 of the most eye-catching promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Free personal care in England\n",
      "\n",
      "The Liberal Democrats plan to introduce free personal care in England, similar to the system that operates in Scotland where people needing help with daily tasks do not have to pay. It is currently means-tested in England, with only the poorest receiving help. The policy sounds attractive, but Scotland has shown, it is not a silver bullet. Much depends on who is eligible for free personal care. While anyone is entitled to ask for an assessment, that does not mean they will get support. Only those with significant needs qualify - and there are signs in Scotland this has had to be more tightly rationed since it was introduced more than 20 years ago. That results in some people still deciding they have to pay for their own personal care in some circumstances. Social care is devolved so these policies would apply to England only.\n",
      "\n",
      "More GPs and faster cancer treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "The Liberal Democrats have promised 8,000 more GPs in England - but the detail here is important. Will these be fully trained GPs, or doctors working in surgeries? The latter are qualified doctors but still in training to do general practice - their number is already increasing, and that has been highlighted by the Conservatives. The number of fully trained GPs in England has fallen in recent years and it takes up to 10 years from the start of medical school to fully qualify for general practice. A key cancer target is for most patients to begin treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral - specifically 85% within that time. But that has been repeatedly missed in England. The Lib Dems say they want to give all urgently referred patients the 62-day guarantee. Given the scale of the backlog, this will be a huge challenge and it’s not clear what timeframe the party have set to make good on their pledge. Health is devolved so these policies would apply to England only.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEIL HALL/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Sir Ed Davey's party they would reduce cancer wait times\n",
      "\n",
      "Increase public spending\n",
      "\n",
      "The Liberal Democrats say they would spend almost £27bn more a year by 2029. They say they would raise levies on banks, which would net an extra £4bn. They also hope to raise more than £5bn from reforming capital gains tax, but revenue there depends on the behaviour of a few tens of thousands of the most wealthy. A new aviation duty would penalise frequent fliers more heavily, but details aren’t finalised. They think they could raise £7bn through cracking down on tax avoidance through investing £1bn in HMRC. They also say they'll keep the freeze on the thresholds at which different rates of taxes on income apply. Current plans have those frozen until 2028. These plans still potentially leave the tax burden, as most manifestos may do, on track for a post-World War Two high. This would apply to the whole of the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap the Rwanda scheme\n",
      "\n",
      "The tone of the Lib Dem manifesto on immigration is more sympathetic and positive than much of the debate on the topic during the campaign. It refers to the UK’s “proud history of welcoming newcomers” and proposes a system that “treats everyone with respect”. There is no mention of reducing immigration numbers, in what is an appeal to the significant proportion of the population who believe migrants benefit the country. The party would abolish the current salary threshold for migrant workers in favour of what it calls a “merit-based” system. They would also end the recently introduced ban on foreign care workers bringing dependents to the UK and reverse the increase in income thresholds for family visas. The party says it would scrap the Rwanda scheme, and \"provide safe and legal routes\" for asylum seekers. This would apply to the whole of the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reach net zero by 2045\n",
      "\n",
      "Ed Davey made no mention of climate change in his summary of his party’s ambitions. The Liberal Democrats had promised “to place tackling the climate crisis at the centre of all our policies.” In the 2024 manifesto, that has become a promise to “put tackling climate change at the heart of a new industrial strategy”. In fact, climate change comes third in the list of priorities in the manifesto, after the economy and business and jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images The Lib Dems say they will incentivise people to install rooftop solar\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lib Dems have retained their ambitious net zero target, 2045 rather than the 2050 target the Conservatives and Labour say they’ll work towards. They say they will accelerate the deployment of solar and wind power so 90% of power will be generated by renewables by 2030 if they are in charge. Among other policies, the party says there’ll be free insulation and heat pumps for those on low incomes, a “rooftop solar revolution” with more incentives for householders to put in solar panels and a new Net Zero Delivery Authority to coordinate climate action - but there are no estimates of costs for these policies. This would apply to the whole of the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap two-child limit and reform Carer’s Allowance\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lib Dems would scrap or reform a range of welfare policies that anti-poverty campaigners have repeatedly said are increasing family hardship, going further than either the Conservatives or Labour have done so far. They plan to remove the two-child limit and benefit cap for Child Benefit payments, and reduce the waiting time for the first Universal Credit payment from five weeks to five days. Over the longer term, they say they'll review annual benefit levels, a step towards what groups like the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Trussell Trust call an “essentials guarantee”. That aims to ensure that benefit levels are high enough for people to be able to afford basic items, such as food and bills. There are plans to reform Carer's Allowance and immediately increase the benefit by £20 a week, expand its eligibility and increase how much people can earn before losing the benefit. There has been criticism recently of the government prosecuting people who've inadvertently claimed Carer's Allowance despite not being eligible; the Lib Dems would introduce an amnesty for many of those cases. Universal Credit and Carer's Allowance both apply across the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Triple the early years pupil premium\n",
      "\n",
      "Giving a better chance to disadvantaged pupils and students in England is the core theme of Lib Dem promises on education. In schools, this includes a tutoring guarantee for children from low-income families who need extra help, and tripling the early years pupil premium - to £1,000 - to front-load support. There is a bold, and potentially expensive, promise to increase school and college funding for each pupil above inflation every year, following 14 years in which it has stagnated in real terms. A young person's premium would target disadvantaged 16- to 18-year-olds. Universities will welcome a review of their funding, although it pushes the issue down the road. Tuition fees in England became toxic for the party after it broke a promise and voted through increased fees of £9,000. For students from low income families there is a promise to bring back maintenance grants, which were scrapped in favour of loans in 2016. This will be welcomed as the loans have not kept up with rising prices, but it is also extra public spending. Education is devolved so these policies would only apply in England\n",
      "\n",
      "Speed up the courts process\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plans to create a more efficient and supportive justice system, although the challenge is significant. The Lib Dems would increase funding, set targets and introduce reforms to ensure the courts are properly staffed and deal with cases more quickly. The party promises to halve the time it take to sentence all criminals from when the offence is committed - a highly ambitious aim. There is a particular emphasis on supporting survivors of domestic abuse and those in mental ill-health. Towards the end of their manifesto section on crime, there is a specific pledge to crack down on kitten and puppy smuggling and a promise to end prison overcrowding – a major challenge for criminal justice, but without details of how it might be achieved or paid for. The justice system is devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, so this would apply to England and Wales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recognise non-binary identities and ban conversion therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-binary identities would be recognised in law under the Lib Dems. Data from the last UK census shows around 30,000 people identify as non-binary - there have been unsuccessful legal attempts to have them legally recognised before. The party also wants to reform the gender recognition process. Currently anyone wanting to change their legally recognised sex has to provide two medical reports, one from a specialist detailing their diagnosis and another listing any treatment or surgery they may have had to change their sexual characteristics. The Lib Dems want to remove the need for medical reports. Labour and the Conservatives have previously pledged to simplify this process. A complete ban on so-called conversion therapy is also promised. Ex-Conservative PM Theresa May first said she would bring in a conversion therapy ban in 2018, but this has not been made law. A ban would be popular among large parts of the LGBT community but also potentially divisive. These policies would not apply in Scotland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give 16-year-olds the vote and bring in proportional representation\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lib Dems think giving a vote to 16- and 17-year-olds will help to engage younger people - many of whom might even vote for them. In Scotland and Wales, 16- and 17-year-olds can already vote in local elections, and those for their national parliaments. Labour has also hinted they’d like to see younger teenagers able to vote in Westminster elections, so it's a change that could be on its way. Trickier to pull off might be voting reform. Smaller parties, like the Liberal Democrats, often feel that under the current system the number of MPs they end up with never really reflects the number of votes they get across the country. They'd like to see a form of proportional representation. But the Lib Dems have already had their chance and tried to make changes back when they were part of the coalition government. In a referendum in 2011, PR was rejected by the public, who weren't convinced the voting system was a problem that needed to be fixed. This would apply to the whole of the UK.\n",

      "Labour has dropped a plan to reintroduce a cap on how much people are allowed to save into their pensions before paying tax. Under the pensions lifetime allowance, pension pots over £1.07m faced an annual tax of £40,000 on average. The cap was scrapped in April but Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves had vowed to bring it back, saying it could raise £800m a year. However, her party has now reversed the decision ahead of the release of its manifesto on Thursday, reportedly because the cap would add uncertainty for savers and be complex to reintroduce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lifetime Allowance (LTA) capped the amount people could hold in their pensions tax-free. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt abolished it in March last year in an attempt to discourage older workers, particularly NHS consultants, from retiring early. At the time, Labour promised to bring back the cap, suggesting it only benefited wealthy savers.

However, she had promised that a Labour government would make exceptions for NHS doctors and other public servants when the cap returned.\n",

      "Nigel Farage questioned on Reform UK candidate's Hitler claim\n",
      "\n",
      "A Reform UK candidate has apologised for claiming the country would be \"far better\" if it had \"taken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality\" instead of fighting the Nazis in World War Two. Ian Gribbin, the party's candidate in Bexhill and Battle, also wrote online that women were the \"sponging gender\" and should be \"deprived of health care\". In posts from 2022 on the Unherd magazine website, seen by the BBC, he said Winston Churchill was \"abysmal\" and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. Initially Mr Gribbin declined to comment, but later said: “I apologise for these old comments and withdraw them unreservedly and the upset that they have caused.” He said that he himself had been “upset at the way these comments were taken out of context especially when my mother was the daughter of Russian Jews fleeing persecution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the comments first came to light, a Reform UK party spokesman suggested they were not endorsements but \"arguing points in long distance debates\". But asked about the comments at a press conference later the party’s Chairman, Richard Tice, said that if people did “inappropriate things” or said “daft things” then the party would “look at it” and “investigate\". Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said \"every party\" would face issues with vetting candidates due to the unexpected election timing, which had cut short the checks parties carry out. In July 2022, Mr Gribbin posted on the Unherd website: \"Britain would be in a far better state today had we taken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality…. but oh no Britain’s warped mindset values weird notions of international morality rather than looking after its own people.\" The same month he wrote: \"In Britain specifically we need to exorcise the cult of Churchill and recognize that in both policy and military strategy, he was abysmal.\" The previous month he criticised women, writing on the site’s message board: \"Do you think you could actually work and pay for it all too like good citizens? \"Men pay 80% of tax – women spend 80% of tax revenue. On aggregate as a group you only take from society. \"Less complaining please from the 'sponging gender'.\" He added that women are \"subsidised by men to merely breath (sic)\". In January 2022 he posted: \"Men pay 80% of tax. Women take out 80% of expenditures. \"Square that inequality first by depriving women of healthcare until their life expectancies are the same as men, Fair’s fair.\" In December 2021 he wrote female soldiers \"almost made me wretch (sic)\" and were a \"total liability\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In the run up to the invasion of Ukraine, he praised President Putin, writing in January 2022 that he had \"shown a maturity of which we can only dream of\". He \"understands the bonds that create more stable societies; the hypocrisy of the West is preposterous as we stare in the face daily the enormous economic equalities created by our deluded neo liberal ideas\", he wrote. In February, Mr Gribbin wrote \"if only the West had politicians of his class\". A Reform UK spokesman initially said: \"Through offence archaeology the BBC has found that Mr Gribbin has made a series of comments about a number of subjects. \"They were written with an eye to inconvenient perspectives and truths. That doesn't make them endorsements, just arguing points in long distance debates. \"His historical perspective of what the UK could have done in the 30s was shared by the vast majority of the British establishment including the BBC of its day, and is probably true. \"Again no endorsement, just pointing out conveniently forgotten truths. \"As for the feminism point, his tongue is so firmly in his cheek one should be able to spot it from 100 yards.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "REUTERS/Phil Noble Labour leader Keir Starmer spoke to parents in Nuneaton about the policy\n",
      "\n",
      "The Labour party has pledged to create 100,000 additional childcare places and more than 3,000 new nurseries as part of its childcare plan. Labour has said it will turn classrooms in existing primary schools into \"school-based nurseries\", for an estimated cost of around £40,000 per classroom. The money would come from VAT levied on private schools - a move which has been previously criticised in the sector and by other parties. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said, if elected, his party would \"create the childcare places needed to turn the page, and rebuild Britain”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of state primary and nursery pupils in England is predicted to fall by 8.8% (397,000) over the next five years. Labour says it will use the space freed up in primary school buildings for the 3,334 new \"high quality\" nurseries, which would be set up in high-need areas which lack enough childcare places. They could be run by the primary schools themselves, or by local private and voluntary sector nursery providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Class war'\n",
      "\n",
      "The funding will come from Labour's plan to remove what it has called \"unfair tax breaks\" from private schools. In a TV debate between the two party leaders last week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he disagreed with Labour's plans to remove the tax breaks and charge private schools 20% value added tax (VAT). \"People who work hard and aspire to provide that education for their kids should have that freedom,\" he said. The prime minister has previously said the policy was part of a \"class war\" to \"punish\" aspirational parents. On Sunday, Labour's shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry told GB News the policy could increase class sizes in state schools in the short term. But her colleague, the party's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson, told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that \"wasn't right\" and that there had been a \"misunderstanding\". And Mr Starmer said the impact on class sizes would be \"negligible\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour said its announcement is the next stage in its long-term plan to deliver a modern childcare system that better supports parents from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school. Speaking on a visit to Nursery Hill Primary School, Nuneaton, Warks, Mr Starmer said developing \"wraparound\" nursery care in primary schools would be a \"game-changer\" for working parents with older children in the school. Ms Phillipson said the party will \"fix\" the childcare system. “The 3,300 new nurseries we announce today will be key to delivering Labour’s mission for half a million more children to hit the early learning goals by 2030, giving them the firm foundations from which to succeed\", she added. Labour had previously announced plans to set up free breakfast clubs in every primary school in England. The party had also committed to stick to government plans for an expansion of funded childcare earlier this year, which saw working parents receive additional free childcare hours from April 2024. The Department for Education has previously said about 85,000 extra childminder and nursery places are needed in England for the expansion to work. During a visit to Stafford College, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said the Conservative party had \"done more on childcare than any other government, ever\". She said most of the nursery places for England were already delivered at schools, \"so that's already being provided\". She accused Labour of \"re-announcing things that we've already done\". \"We've already announced the policy, we've already started delivering it... and it's already successfully being rolled out,\" she said. A spokesperson from the Liberal Democrats told BBC News that \"flexible, affordable childcare is critical for giving parents more choice over how to organise their lives, helping them return to work if they want to, and tackling the gender pay gap\". \"But affordable childcare is only part of the picture\", they added. The spokesperson said that the Liberal Democrats will also set out plans to \"transform\" parental leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gender equality charity the Fawcett Society welcomed Labour's plan, and said it was \"about time childcare became an election priority\". \"We need to see childcare given the prominence it deserves in every party’s manifesto and we need to see genuine, long-term commitments that last beyond this election,\" the charity added. The charity said 85% of mothers struggle to find childcare that fits around their jobs, leading many to stop working. Sarah Ronan, director of the Early Education and Childcare Coalition, said: “Labour’s commitment to increasing the number of places is the right one, however if you boost places you have to also boost staff numbers, so underpinning its plan for reform must be a new workforce strategy that will attract more people into the sector and see early years professionals receive the pay, conditions and respect they deserve.” The charity Pregnant Then Screwed welcomed the \"first stage plan\" to reform the sector. \"There is little point in reducing the cost of childcare for parents if they cannot access a place, and with long waiting lists, and childcare deserts across England, it is imperative we do not continue to paper over the cracks,\" its founder, Joeli Brearley, said.\n",

      "Getty Images Douglas Ross said it was not feasible for him to continue in three roles - as MSP, MP and party leader\n",
      "\n",
      "Douglas Ross has announced he will resign as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. He will carry on in the role until after the election and will also resign as an MSP if he is re-elected to Westminster. It follows a row over Mr Ross standing as a candidate for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East instead of David Duguid, who has been in hospital and was in effect de-selected. Mr Ross said he originally thought he could continue to serve as an MSP and MP as well as party leader, but said \"on reflection, that is not feasible\". He was the only MSP to also serve as an MP in the current Holyrood session before the UK Parliament dissolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Duguid, who had held the Banff and Buchan seat since 2017, had already been adopted by local party members and has disputed suggestions that he is \"seriously ill\". On Monday, a Scottish Conservative source told BBC News that Mr Ross had come to the realisation that the party's MSPs would not \"put up\" with him serving as both an MP and an MSP. They added that the reaction to him announcing plans to stand in place of Mr Duguid was another factor. The seat has recently been redrawn as Aberdeenshire North and Moray East. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Ross said colleagues had told him over the weekend they were \"uncomfortable\" with his decision to stand. He said he had to make the choice \"overnight\" and that the party management board had made \"difficult decisions\" on no longer having Mr Duguid in the running.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ross: Colleagues uncomfortable with me standing as MP\n",
      "\n",
      "He said: \"I was delighted and honoured to get the support of local members to be their candidate. \"But I also recognise in the three years that I’ve been party leader, MP and MSP have been different circumstances and that’s why I want to give the commitment to the people of Aberdeenshire North and Moray East that if they elect me as their local representative they will be my number one priority and they will have my full focus.\" Pressed on whether he had mishandled the situation, Mr Ross said \"everything can be done differently with hindsight\", adding: \"I’m resigning as party leader, I think that’s quite a clear indication that I have taken a decision that I think is right in these circumstances.\" Mr Ross also came under pressure at the weekend when the Sunday Mail reported that his own advisers had raised concerns over 28 parliamentary travel claims which may have been combined with his work as a football linesman. He said the expenses claims were approved by the independent parliamentary body IPSA and he would have \"no issue\" with the expenses being examined for a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "SNS Mr Ross pictured as assistant referee during a match between Hearts and Partick Thistle in August last year\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had enjoyed working with Mr Ross, but respected his decision to step down. He said: \"He’s been a steadfast champion for the union but also he and I have worked together on delivering two freeports for Scotland attracting jobs and investment, standing up to the SNP’s misguided gender recognition reforms and also being unashamedly champions of Scotland’s north sea energy industry – the only party to consistently have done that. \"I think that’s a track record that Douglas can be proud of.\" In 2016, Mr Ross became the MSP for Highlands and Islands via the list system. Following the unexpected resignation of Jackson Carlaw, he quickly became the leader of the Scottish Conservatives in August 2020. Mr Carlaw said that a \"younger and fresher voice\" was needed to lead the party into the next Scottish Parliament election. At the time Mr Ross was seen as a close ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who spoke to him shortly after he was confirmed as leader - despite opposing Brexit in the EU referendum. However he was also at times critical of Boris Johnson's leadership. Before leading the Scottish Conservatives, he had resigned as a Scotland Office minister when the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings refused to quit for making a trip from London to Durham during lockdown. In January 2022, Mr Ross withdrew his support for Boris Johnson saying his position had become \"untenable\" over lockdown parties, and he called for a no-confidence vote. He then reversed that position when the war in Ukraine started, arguing that political upheaval at home would play into the hands of Vladimir Putin. In a double U-turn, Mr Ross later voted for the motion of no confidence in Mr Johnson's leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a party leader announces their resignation in the middle of an election campaign, you know something has gone very wrong. For Douglas Ross, it was replacing the hospitalised David Duguid as his party’s candidate in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East at the general election. Some were uneasy about the optics of the party leader swooping in when a colleague was ill. But what had gone down really badly with Conservative MSPs at Holyrood was the plan to continue to try and carry on as both an MP and an MSP. Douglas Ross had previously promised he wouldn’t do that. One of his Scottish Tory colleagues told me last week it had been received \"like a bucket of cold sick\". So Mr Ross will leave Holyrood if re-elected to Westminster. Some of his colleagues feel that's where his heart has always really been. Pressure piled up on him over the weekend and may well have intensified with the newspaper story about his expenses. His decision will impact on the UK-wide campaign too. Rishi Sunak won’t have factored in his Scottish leader calling it a day in the run-up to polling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final list of candidates for the Aberdeenshire North and Moray East constituency was published on Friday. Ian Bailey is standing for the Liberal Democrats, Andy Brown for Labour, Jo Hart for Reform UK, Seamus Logan for the SNP and Douglas Ross for the Conservatives. Following Mr Ross's announcement, SNP leader John Swinney accused him of taking voters for granted and treating them with \"contempt\". He said: \"He wants to have it on his terms. \"Well, when you're in politics, you're in it on the terms of the electorate. We all accept that. It's the electorate that decides.\" Alba leader Alex Salmond said it was the \"first case of a rat deserting a sinking ship while simultaneously trying to clamber aboard a gravy train\". He called on him to resign as a candidate for the Westminster seat, adding that Mr Ross was \"totally devoid of honour\". Scottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie wished Mr Ross luck in the future, reserving her criticism for the Conservative party and UK government. She said: \"Voters know that this rotten Tory government has nothing to offer Scotland – it’s no wonder Douglas Ross has given up on trying to resuscitate the Scottish Tories’ flailing campaign.\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said the move was proof the party was in \"abject disarray\". “Just like the SNP, the Tories have been in power for too long, breaking rules and taking you for granted,\" he said. And Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, told BBC News it has \"never been clear\" what Mr Ross' focus was between working as an MSP, an MP and a football linesman. She said: “I think its clear that the Tory party, UK-wide including in Scotland is toast. They’re on their way out so whoever takes on that role for the Scottish Tories, it’s going to be a pretty thankless task.”\n",

      "All parties should commit to an \"ambitious\" programme of climate policies, say a group of the UK's leading climate scientists. In an open letter, published on Monday, the academics said if the parties do not make this pledge they are not deserving of support. It comes as the political parties are expected to announce their manifestos for the July election. The UK currently has a target to reduce its planet-warming gases to net zero by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter has been signed by 408 members of the UK's climate science community - some of the most distinguished of the country's academics. Recognisable names include Professor Sir Brian Hoskins, Professor Emily Shuckburgh and Professor Sir David King who was the government's Chief Scientific Adviser between 2000 and 2007. He was considered instrumental in raising the issue of climate change within the government, which led to the Climate Change Act being signed in 2008. This latest intervention in the election follows a plea to the UK's TV networks from environmental groups to make sure climate change is discussed in the upcoming debates.\n",

      "Lead by example internationally on climate change The UK was the first major economy to set a net zero emissions target but last year the government's independent advisors said it had lost its leadership on the issue following a change to a number of policies including delaying the ban on petrol and diesel vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as highlighting the need for any future government to support poorer countries in their efforts on climate change, the letter also points out that UK residents are already feeling the effects of a warming planet. The scientists draw attention to the summer heatwave of 2022 that saw thousands of excess deaths and devastation to agricultural yields as a result of 40C temperatures. The letter says if a party leader does not make climate change a priority they \"will place the prosperity and well-being of the British people at severe risk\".\n",

      "A Labour spokesperson said in response: “Labour will make Britain the first major country in the world to deliver clean power by 2030, end new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea, and making the UK a climate finance leader with 1.5 degrees transition plans.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the letter the Green Party told the BBC: \"Here we have 408 scholars who have dedicated their careers to understanding the climate crisis demanding not more words, but real action. \"Their call for an ambitious climate programme aligns closely with how The Green Party sees the role of political and government leadership in transitioning us to a more sustainable and secure future.\" A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said in response that they are \"ready to lead the way with ambitious policies to tackle climate change; cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045 while reducing the bills that have been hurting families and businesses.\" A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said the party: \"reaffirms our commitment to reaching net zero targets in Wales by 2035 and reversing biodiversity decline by 2030. A key pillar of achieving this in Wales is securing energy independence for our nation – including control over our natural resources through devolution of the £835m worth crown estate and full control over energy powers without any conditions set by the UK Government.\" On Friday, during the BBC's election debate, Conservative cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt said: \"What is critical is if you want to reach net zero by 2050 you have to do it with people [on board].\" \"We are going to do this at a pace that people can afford... if you do this too fast you destroy our supply chain.\" During the same debate Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform Party, said: \"At the moment we are pursuing completely unrealistic climate pledges. It is impossible and unaffordable.\" Stephen Flynn, Westminster leader of the SNP, said: \"Net Zero is economic growth, the opportunities are huge but we have to grasp them.\"\n",

      "The Conservative Party is promising to recruit 8,000 additional police officers over the next three years if they win the General Election. Under the plans, the new neighbourhood police officers would also be given increased powers to seize knives and recover stolen goods. The policing uplift programme would partly be paid for by increasing visa fees and removing the student discount to the Immigration Health surcharge, the party said. Labour said the government had \"decimated neighbourhood policing\" since coming to power in 2010, describing the pledge as \"another empty promise\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tory party suggested the new, \"fully warranted\" officers would join neighbourhood policing teams across the country - promising the equivalent of one additional police officer for every ward in England and Wales. \"Abstraction\" of the new recruits - where officers are pulled off their beat to fill gaps elsewhere in the force - would only be permitted in \"exceptional circumstances\", the Conservatives said. Policing minister Chris Philp told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the new officers would be \"dedicated\" to neighbourhood policing. \"That means policing our local areas and responding to local crime investigation requirements,\" he added. He said his party had kicked off a \"recruitment spree\" in 2019 and were now proposing to go \"even further\". The new police officers would join the 20,000 already recruited since 2019, the Tories added. However, critics say the 20,000 officers recruited since the last general election - as part of a major 2019 election pledge by the Conservatives - had simply replaced the 20,000 officers who left the force between 2010 and 2019, after government funding was cut by 20%. In addition to boosting neighbourhood policing teams, the new measures would strengthen police powers to seize and destroy blades such as \"Zombie\" knives and machetes, the Conservatives said. Police would also be able to enter premises without a warrant to seize stolen goods such as phones, the party added. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: \"More bobbies on the beat and increased powers will give police forces the tools they need to drive down neighbourhood crime even further.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conservatives took aim at Labour's pledge to boost local police patrols by 13,000 if they win the general election, claiming only 3,000 officers would be \"fully warranted\" and \"full time\". This is because part of Labour's total number of new recruits would be comprised of PSCOs - officers who share some, but not all of the powers afforded to police - as well as special constables, who work on a voluntary basis. Labour told the BBC all the positions created under a Labour government would be \"full time\". The party says it would fund the move by cutting \"back-office waste\". Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: “The Tories have repeatedly promised more police on the beat but instead they have cut 10,000 neighbourhood police, 90% of crimes are going unsolved, prisons are in crisis and more than twice as many people now say they never see the police on the beat.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Rishi Sunak has said he has not considered resigning as prime minister before polling day, despite facing a backlash for leaving D-Day commemorations early. The prime minister apologised on Friday for not attending the full event to mark the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings the previous day. The decision was criticised by opposition parties, as well as some Conservatives, with Cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt saying it was \"completely wrong\" and Mr Sunak had \"rightly apologised\". Mr Sunak said there was \"enormous support\" for Conservative policies adding: \"I'm not going to stop fighting for people's votes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the weekend, Mr Sunak kept a low profile, avoiding questions from reporters on the campaign trail. In his first interview since Friday's apology, during a campaign visit in Horsham, West Sussex, the PM was asked if he had considered resigning. “No, of course not. I'm energised about the vision we're putting forward for the country,\" he said. \"This campaign is not even half way through yet. I'm finding enormous support for the policies that we're putting on the table.\" He added: \"The reality is I'm not going to stop going, I'm not going to stop fighting for people's votes, I'm not going to stop fighting for the future of our country.\" In response Liberal Democrat local government spokeswoman Helen Morgan said: \"This is rock bottom for Rishi Sunak. A Conservative leader having to rule out resigning before election day shows that the wheels have completely come off the Conservative campaign.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Sunak said he had not \"meant to cause anyone any hurt or upset\" by leaving the D-Day event early and had \"apologised unreservedly for the mistake I made\". He added: \"I just hope people can find it in their hearts to forgive me and look at my actions that I've taken as prime minister, both to support our armed forces with an increase in defence spending, but also have the minister focused on veterans affairs around the cabinet table, making sure this is best country in the world to be a veteran.\" Last week Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed Mr Sunak had demonstrated he did not understand “our culture” by leaving the event early and was \"disconnected by class [and] by privilege\" from ordinary people. Asked what he made of Mr Farage’s remarks, the PM said: “I can't speak for him and what he meant by those comments. \"I'm not going to get involved in that because I don't think it's good for our politics, or indeed our country.” Conservative minister Mel Stride said Mr Farage's comment made him \"very uncomfortable\", while Labour's Shabana Mahmood called it a \"dog whistle\".\n",

      "\n",
      "TV and podcast presenter Michael Mosley was best known for offering tips on simple ways to improve our health and wellbeing, backed up by science - everything from when to exercise and what to eat to how to get more sleep. He was often the guinea pig - willing to try out anything before recommending it to others (swallowing tapeworms and trying psychedelic drugs, for example). \"Michael wanted to look at whatever would help people live better, healthier lives,\" says his former co-presenter on Trust me I'm a Doctor, Dr Saleyha Ahsan. \"Something that wasn't a fad, that they could keep going at and which they didn't feel guilty about.\" We pick out his top five health hacks:\n",
      "\n",
      "Eat less on two days a week\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images A light, healthy breakfast could be part of a fasting day when far fewer calories should be consumed\n",
      "\n",
      "He popularised the idea of intermittent fasting - eating normally on five days a week and much less than usual on the other two, in order to lose weight and boost your health. It's called the 5:2 diet, and it sparked huge interest when his Horizon TV programme Eat, Fast and Live Longer was broadcast more than 10 years ago. Wanting to reverse his type 2 diabetes, he stuck to the diet for five weeks, eating fewer than 600 calories on fasting days, with a light breakfast and dinner and plenty of water and herbal tea in between. During that time, he lost nearly a stone and his blood markers, including glucose and cholesterol, improved. The notion of fasting to cut calories got the nation talking and spawned fasting recipes, calorie-restricted menus and even a book. To make it even easier, he challenged people to simply try staying away from food for 12 hours during the night, between 8pm and 8am - something called time-restricted eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short bursts of exercise\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Brisk walking and taking the stairs at work are good ways to \"snack\" on exercise\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing the recommended amount of exercise each week is a challenge for many. \"When do I find the time?\" is the frequent complaint. Dr Mosley's Just One Thing podcast researched the concept of \"exercise snacking\" - doing a few minutes of physical activity whenever possible, rather than scheduling one long gym session that might not happen. For those with busy lives, he suggested shunning the lift and running up the stairs instead, and going for brisk walks, particularly first thing in the morning. \"We live at the top of a steep hill - I always cycle down to the town for the shopping and push myself hard on the way back,\" he said on the podcast, illustrating how to make exercise an integral part of his daily routine. He also investigated the more controversial concept of high-intensity interval training, or HIIT - short bursts of intense exercise with periods of recovery in between - as a way of maximising workout time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Embracing the cold\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr Mosley was fascinated by how cold temperatures could be harnessed to help our health and wellbeing. He investigated the benefits of everything from taking cold showers to exercising in the cold and sleeping in a cool bedroom. In interviews, he revealed how he liked to turn the heating down at home. \"I live in an old house which is expensive to heat - so we pile on layers of clothes and keep the thermostat at about 15 degrees,\" he said, adding that his wife was less keen on the arrangement. He discovered that turning the thermostat down by just a few degrees could improve fat and blood-sugar metabolism, boost your mood, and might even protect against type 2 diabetes. When he went for a jog on a chilly day, he found out how exercising in colder weather can allow you to go further than on a hot day, enabling you to work harder, for longer, with less effort. And he was also a fan of taking cold showers (like motivational speaker and extreme athlete Wim Hoff), admitting he started every morning in a warm shower and turned it to cold for around 30-to-40 seconds. The body's reaction to being immersed in cold water - the cold shock response - forces up the heart rate and makes you breathe more quickly, which is thought to be beneficial in short bursts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Squats and planks\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the best simple exercise you can do,\" said Dr Mosley in a recent interview. What was he talking about? Squats, press-ups and planks. These are resistance exercises, working some of the biggest muscles in the body. When muscles are tensed and held still, as these exercises demand, research suggests there is a sudden rush of blood when you relax, which can reduce blood pressure. As they are potentially better than doing crunches or sit-ups for the core muscles, he would do squats every morning - before his cold shower, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food choices\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images A potentially under-rated vegetable?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of us know what we should be doing to eat healthily - eating plenty of fruit and vegetables and cutting back on fatty and sugar-laden foods being the primary objectives. But are there hidden health benefits in some foods? Thanks to Dr Mosley, we learned it's potentially better to cook tomatoes than eat them raw. Tomatoes contain a powerful antioxidant, called lycopine, which helps the body fight off damaging chemicals, and cooking the red fruit lets the good stuff out and into the body. And when it comes to beetroot, he concluded it was best to buy it raw and bake it, or drink the juice to enjoy this nitrate-rich purple veg. Mosley looked at the merits of fermented foods, such as yoghurt, kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut, and found they helped introduce live microbes into the gut and could improve the body's immune system and reduce inflammation. But he wasn't against eating the odd bit of chocolate, particularly when it was dark - much healthier than the milky version, according to studies. One unexpected discovery he made was that eating pasta cold is healthier than eating it hot. When cold, it was found to act more like fibre and less like a starchy carbohydrate. In a small trial in hungry people, eating cold pasta led to a smaller spike in blood glucose and insulin than eating freshly boiled pasta.\n",

      "Content: Why the EU might be about to make Chinese electric cars more expensive\n",
      "\n",
      "5 hours ago By Theo Leggett , BBC international business correspondent Share\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Chinese firms are said to be able to make electric cars for 25% less than their European and US rivals\n",
      "\n",
      "With China accused of selling electric cars at artificially low prices, the European Union is widely expected to hit them with tariffs this week. The BYD Seagull is a tiny, cheap, neatly styled electric vehicle (EV). An urban runabout that won’t break any speed records, but nor will it break the bank. In China, it has a starting price of 69,800 yuan ($9,600; £7,500). If it comes to Europe, it is expected to cost at least double that figure due to safety regulations. But that would still be, by electric car standards, very cheap. For European manufacturers that is a worrying prospect. They fear the little Seagull will become an invasive species, one of a number of Chinese-built models poised to colonise their own markets at the expense of indigenous vehicles. China’s domestic auto industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Its development, along with that of the battery sector, was a major component of the “Made In China 2025” strategy, a 10-year industrial policy launched by the Communist Party in Beijing in 2015. The result has been the breakneck development of companies like BYD, now vying with Tesla for the title of the world’s biggest manufacturer of electric vehicles. Established giants such as SAIC, the owner of the MG brand, and Volvo’s owner Geely, have also become big players in the EV market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, more than eight million electric vehicles were sold in China – about 60% of the global total, according to the International Energy Agency’s annual Global EV Outlook. For policymakers in Europe and the US, however, this is a cause for concern. With Chinese brands having plenty of surplus capacity and moving into international markets, they fear their own companies will be unable to compete. They claim hefty subsidies for domestic production allow Chinese firms to keep prices at a level other firms will struggle to match. According to a report by the Swiss bank UBS, published in September, the Chinese advantage is real. It suggested that BYD could produce cars at some 25% lower cost than the best of the legacy global carmakers. It said BYD and other Chinese firms were “set to conquer the world market with high-tech, low-cost EVs for the masses”. Meanwhile, earlier this year, the Alliance for American Manufacturing warned that the introduction of cheap Chinese cars could be an “extinction-level event” for the US auto industry. It called for a “dedicated and concerted effort to turn those imports back”, concluding that there was “no time to lose”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, the US took decisive action. The Biden administration raised its tariff on imports of Chinese battery-powered cars from 25% to 100%. Sales of Chinese-made EVs in the US are currently negligible; with the new tariffs, they are likely to stay that way. The move was part art of a wider package of measures targeting imports from China that has been condemned by Beijing as \"naked protectionism\". At the same time, the US is subsidising its own car industry, through tax incentives that make domestically-produced vehicles cheaper to buy. The EU appears to be taking a more moderate approach, despite tough rhetoric. In her state of the Union address in September last year, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced an investigation into Chinese imports. “Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars,\" she said. “Their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market.” The initial results of that investigation are now imminent. It is widely expected that the Commission will provisionally raise duties on EVs imported from China, from the standard level of 10% for third country imports to between 20 and 25%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Ursula von der Leyen has accused China of selling EVs for artificially low prices\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research, this would be a rather more proportionate response than the US move. “The 100% tariff is just pure protectionism, regressive and stifles innovation, and prevents a competitive landscape for the consumer,\" he says. “If the EU imposes tariffs of no more than 25%, it will be more about levelling the playing field, and evening out the 30% cost advantage Chinese manufacturers have.\" Nevertheless, tariffs could hurt European companies as well as helping them. Firstly, they would not just affect Chinese brands. For example, BMW’s iX3 electric SUV is built at a factory in Dadong and exported to Europe. The company also intends to import large quantities of Chinese-made electric Minis. Both models would be subject to the tariffs, leaving the manufacturer to absorb the extra cost, or raise prices. The US manufacturer Tesla would also be affected, as it builds cars in Shanghai for export to Europe. Secondly, although European makes have invested heavily in production in China in recent years, in partnership with local manufacturers, a number of them still export high-value models to Chinese markets. If China wanted to retaliate by imposing its own hefty tariffs, these shipments could be targeted.\n",

      "If diplomats have groundhog days, when they are condemned to reliving the same 24 hours, perhaps Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, felt a certain weariness as his jet approached the Middle East on his latest trip. It is his eighth diplomatic tour of the region in the eight months since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year. The politics of trying to negotiate an end to the war in Gaza and an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners were already complicated. They are more tangled than ever now that the Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz has resigned from the war cabinet of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with his political ally Gadi Eisenkot. Both men are retired generals who led the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as chiefs of staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Benny Gantz's resignation from Israel's war cabinet presents another challenge for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n",

      "Without Benny Gantz, the Americans have lost their favourite contact in the cabinet. Now he’s back in opposition, Mr Gantz wants new elections - he is the pollsters’ favourite to be the next prime minister - but Mr Netanyahu is safe as long as he can preserve the coalition that gives him 64 votes in the 120-member Israeli parliament. That depends on keeping the support of the leaders of two ultranationalist factions. They are Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister. That is the point at which Secretary of State Blinken’s mission collides with Israeli politics. President Joe Biden believes that the time has come to end the war in Gaza. Mr Blinken’s job is to try to make that happen. But Messrs Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have threatened to bring down the Netanyahu government if he agrees to any ceasefire until they are satisfied that Hamas has been eliminated. They are extreme Jewish nationalists, who want the war to continue until no trace of Hamas remains. They believe that Gaza, like all the territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan, is Jewish land that should be settled by Jews. Palestinians, they argue, could be encouraged to leave Gaza \"voluntarily\".\n",

      "Reuters The war in Gaza is still raging after eight months\n",

      "Antony Blinken is in the Middle East to try to stop the latest ceasefire plan from going the way of all the others. Three ceasefire resolutions in the UN Security Council were vetoed by the US, but now Joe Biden is ready for a deal. On 31 May, the president made a speech urging Hamas to accept what he said was a new Israeli proposal to end the war in Gaza. It was a three-part deal - which has now been backed by a UN resolution - starting with a six-week ceasefire, a \"surge\" of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the exchange of some Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The deal would progress to the release of all the hostages, a permanent “cessation of hostilities” and ultimately the huge job of rebuilding Gaza. Israelis should no longer fear Hamas, he said, because it was no longer able to repeat 7 October. President Biden and his advisers knew there was trouble ahead. Hamas insists it will only agree to a ceasefire that guarantees an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. The destruction and civilian death inflicted by Israel in Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza during the raid to free four hostages last week can only have strengthened that resolve. The Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza say that 274 Palestinians were killed during the raid. The IDF says the number was less than 100. Mr Biden also recognised that some powerful forces in Israel would object. \"I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal,\" he said in the speech. \"Regardless of whatever pressure comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Benjamin Netanyahu is now more reliant on ultranationalist factions in his governing coalition\n",
      "\n",
      "The pressure came quickly, from Messrs Ben Gvir and Smotrich. They are senior government ministers, viscerally opposed to the deal that Joe Biden presented. It made no difference to them that the deal was approved by the war cabinet, as they are not members. As expected, they threatened to topple the Netanyahu coalition if he agreed to the deal. Neither Hamas nor Israel have publicly committed to the deal that President Biden laid out. He accepted that the language of parts of it needed to be finalised. The ambiguity in parts of the proposal might in other conflicts, between other belligerents, allow room for diplomatic manoeuvre. But that would require a shared realisation that the time had come to make a deal, that more war would not bring any benefit. There is no sign that the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is at that point. He seems determined to stick the course he has followed since 7 October. Some reports out of Gaza said that Palestinians in the ruins of Nuseirat camp were swearing at Hamas as well as Israel for disregarding their lives. The BBC cannot confirm that, as like other international news organisations it is not allowed by Israel and Egypt to enter Gaza, except under rare and highly supervised trips with the Israeli military.\n",

They will focus on the fact that the killing of more than 37,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians – according to the health ministry in Gaza – have brought Israel into deep disrepute. It faces a case alleging genocide at the International Court of Justice, and applications at the International Criminal Court for arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost two members of the war cabinet, Messrs Gantz and Eisenkot, who wanted a pause in the war to allow negotiations to free hostages. He is more exposed, without the political insulation they provided, to the hardliners, Messrs Ben-Gvir and Smotrich.\n",

      "Getty Images The ANC under Nelson Mandela achieved its aim of ending white-minority rule in South Africa in 1994\n",
      "\n",
      "Africa’s oldest liberation movement is in trouble and may be going the way of similar groups across the continent. The African National Congress (ANC) - founded in South Africa more than a century ago - has lost its majority in parliament for the first time in 30 years, although it remains by far the country's most popular party. No longer, it seems, were large numbers of voters reflexively willing to give the party of Nelson Mandela their support because it had lead the struggle against the racist apartheid system. This mirrors the decline of other parties that battled colonial rule and made it to power, which have subsequently fallen prey to corruption, cronyism and a disgruntled population hungry for change. Some of those liberation movements which remain in power in southern Africa are accused of only doing so by stealing elections. “It is inevitable that people will start to want change,” said researcher David Soler Crespo, who has written about the “slow death of liberation movements”. “It’s impossible for the same party to be democratically elected for 100 years.” However, they have managed to impose a strong grip, not only on the apparatus of power, but also on the psyche of the nation. As the successful movements transitioned from the bush to the office, they touted themselves as the only ones that could lead. They ingrained the movement into the DNA of the country, making it difficult to separate the party from the state. In Namibia, the phrase “Swapo is the nation, and the nation is Swapo” used during its struggle against apartheid South African rule, remains potent.\n",
      "\n",
      "AFP Zambia's founding father Kenneth Kaunda hosted Nelson Mandela in 1990, just weeks after the ANC leader was freed, before losing elections the following year\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking across the region, civil servants and government appointees, especially in the security forces and state-controlled media were often former guerrilla fighters, who may have put loyalty to the party before the nation. \"There is no line between state and party. It’s more than a party, it's a system,” said Mr Crespo. And the legacy of liberation is deeply embedded in the region's culture, with stories of struggle shared across family dinner tables and national media continually reminding citizens of their hard-won freedom. Liberation songs and war cries are sung in high schools, even at sports matches. For citizens to move away from the liberation party is a big psychological wrench. But over time it does happen. “People are no longer influenced by history when they vote,” Namibian social scientist Ndumba Kamwanyah told the BBC, reflecting on the declining support for Swapo, which has been in power since 1990. Many of the parties espoused socialist ideologies, but these have often fallen by the wayside over time and people have questioned whether citizens are benefitting equally. One of the first independence movements in southern Africa to feel this disdain for history was Zambia’s United National Independence Party (Unip), which came into power in 1964 as British rule ended. Throughout most of the 1970s and 1980s it governed the country as the sole legal party, with founding father Kenneth Kaunda at the helm. But discontent grew and in 1990 there were deadly protests in the capital, Lusaka, and a coup attempt. The following year, the first multi-party elections for more than two decades saw President Kaunda lose out to Frederick Chiluba. Unip, once all-powerful, has now all but disappeared. Liberation movements in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe remain in power but have all experienced a decline in support and vote share in general elections.\n",

      "In Namibia, 2019 marked a watershed for Swapo as it lost its two-thirds parliamentary majority. In the presidential election, Hage Geingob also suffered a sobering decline in popularity as his share of the vote dropped from 87% in 2014 to 56%. The following year, Swapo suffered historic losses in regional and local elections. Prof Kamwanyah, who campaigned for the party more than 30 years ago, says he maintains a deep respect for what the liberation government achieved in the past, but he is disappointed with the present reality. \"What the party is doing doesn't reflect the core original values of why people died for this country,” the Namibian academic said. Namibia will hold its general election in November and there is some speculation that it could suffer the same fate as the ANC. “I think Swapo will win, but they will not get a majority,” Prof Kamwanyah said. Ndiilokelwa Nthengwe, a 26-year-old Namibian activist, says there has been a generational shift. “Our generation's values don’t align with the government,” she told the BBC. Ms Nthengwe has been at the forefront of many social movements in the country. Young people value sexual and gender equality, she says, along with jobs and better healthcare. \"All the youth want is change, change, and more change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "AFP The popularity of the parties once led by Robert Mugabe (L) in Zimbabwe, Nelson Mandela (C) in South Africa and Sam Nujoma (R) in Namibia have all declined\n",
      "\n",
      "But whereas Namibia, along with South Africa, are seen as relatively open democracies, the governing parties in Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique have been accused of shutting down dissent in order to maintain their hold on power. Election rigging, suppressing opposition parties and voter intimidation have been among their alleged tactics. Adriano Nuvunga, chairperson of the Southern Defenders Observer Mission, has witnessed elections in Mozambique for the last two decades. “All of the elections I’ve observed since 1999 were fraudulent,” said Mr Nuvunga. He says he also saw voter intimidation and ballot tampering. In Zimbabwe in 2008 Amnesty International documented unlawful killings, torture and other ill-treatment of opposition supporters between the first round and second round of the presidential vote. In fact most of Zimbabwe's elections have been marred by allegations of tampering or intimidation of the opposition, although this is always denied by the ruling party, Zanu-PF. Following the 2022 elections in Angola, thousands of people took to the streets to protest against alleged electoral fraud. The longer the liberation movements have stayed in power, the more they are accused of corruption and cronyism and not governing in the interests of the people. Chris Hani, the late South African anti-apartheid hero, foresaw this when he said: “What I fear is that the liberators emerge as elitists who drive around in Mercedes Benzes and use the resources of this country to live in palaces and gather riches.” But one former Zimbabwean liberation fighter, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that many of the movements had not had enough time to come to grips with the world order. He pointed out that Europe endured authoritarian monarchies ruling for centuries and they have had time to learn and adapt. “Liberation governments are still playing catch-up in a world that wasn’t designed for them,” he said. Overthrowing colonial and white-minority rule was hard, but governing has brought other challenges. Leading a revolutionary movement requires a single-mindedness and strict loyalty, while running a country needs greater flexibility, collaboration and the ability to balance the interests of different sections of the population. Some movements have fallen short on this. And they may not have much time left. But Mr Crespo maintains that if these parties reclaim the ideals that brought them into government, listen to the youth and find themselves again, they may be able to hold on a little longer.\n",

      "It's the morning after the death of 19-year-old Shawn Seesahai in Wolverhampton. Two 12-year-olds and some friends are talking on Snapchat after a video of the police cordon around the murder scene is shared in a group chat. The conversation makes for difficult reading. \"Someone got stabbed, everyone talking abt (sic) it, literally everyone, everyone knows.\" One of the pair responds with a voice note. \"It is what it is,\" he says, before they share a final exchange. \"I’m scared man.\" \"I’m not.\" \"IDRC\" - which means \"I don’t really care\".\n",

      "\n",
      "The boys blamed each other, but a jury agreed both had been responsible for Shawn Seesahai's death, even if only one had struck the fatal blows with the machete in the park in November. They become the youngest murderers convicted since Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were detained for killing James Bulger, more than 30 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Midlands Police The machete used to kill Shawn was found under the bed of one of the boys\n",
      "\n",
      "Dressed smartly in court, the pair looked like typical 12-year-olds. But one seems to have had a fascination with knives. The internet search history of the boy who owned the machete showed he spent a lot of time searching for similar weapons. He had posed for a photo with the murder weapon and boasted about it to two girls who had been with the pair in the park that day. One of the girls told police it was not unusual for him to carry the machete and the two boys would pass it between them. On the day of the encounter with Shawn, one of them pulled the machete out of his trousers before saying to him, \"keep stepping\". Moments later the vicious attack began.\n",

      "Helen Tipper The two boys were flanked by specialist intermediaries throughout the trial\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it is rare for anyone this age to be tried for such a serious offence, the West Midlands has the highest rate of knife crime in the country. There have been warnings from youth workers that more very young children are carrying bladed weapons, and that getting hold of them has become too easy. The officer in charge of the investigation, Det Insp Damian Forrest, described the case as \"exceptional\". \"It’s not the first case I’ve investigated involving a young man losing his life to knife crime, but it's the first time I've looked at two 12-year-olds being responsible, and that's something that took me by surprise and will stay with me,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Midlands Police One of the boys had an image of a sword on his mobile phone\n",
      "\n",
      "Special arrangements had to be made at the trial because of the defendants' ages. The boys sat in the main well of the court instead of the dock. Alongside them were family members and specially trained staff to help them understand proceedings. The trial took place in one of the smaller courts in Nottingham to create a less intimidatory atmosphere. None of the legal staff wore wigs or gowns and instead dressed in business suits. The court sessions were reduced to roughly 40 minutes and longer breaks were taken than there would normally be in an adult trial. The court day finished earlier at 15:30 so the boys would not become too tired, and they were offered fidget toys to aid with concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Midlands Police The attack was captured on CCTV but it was unclear what exchange took place\n",
      "\n",
      "Trials involving very young children often lead to intense debate about whether there are societal lessons to be learned. It happened in 1968 when Mary Bell was convicted of the manslaughter of two children, aged four and three - the first on the day before she turned 11, and the second a few weeks later. It happened again after Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, both aged 10, murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993.\n",
      "\n",
      "This case begs the question - how did a 12-year-old boy get hold of a machete? It's not clear, but police think it may have been bought online. It bears striking similarities to Ronan Kanda's murder, which happened about two-and-a-half miles away just 18 months earlier. He was attacked by two 17-year-olds outside his home with a machete in a case of mistaken identity. His killers had also bought that weapon online.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Midlands Police The murder happened at Stowlawn playing fields\n",
      "\n",
      "Weapons like those used in both murders are legally available to buy online to over-18s, although it is illegal to carry them without \"good reason\". The government had announced plans to tighten the law, but it is not clear now what will happen after the general election. \"We have to block all avenues and not allow these weapons to be so easily accessible,\" Ronan Kanda’s sister, Nikita, said. \"The government definitely needs to do more. They need to act fast because too many lives are being lost now.\" Her brother’s murderers managed to bypass rules that prevent under-18s buying such weapons, and the boy who bought the machete used to kill Shawn Seesahai said he bought it for £40 from a \"friend of a friend\". Questions remain about whether weapons like machetes ought to be allowed for sale in this country, as do fears that very young children can get their hands on them, and are not afraid to use them.\n",

      "We’re in the midst of a Moon rush. A growing number of countries and companies have the lunar surface in their sights in a race for resources and space dominance. So are we ready for this new era of lunar exploration? This week, images were beamed back to Earth of China’s flag unfurled on the Moon. It’s the country’s fourth landing there - and the first ever mission to return samples from the Moon’s far side. In the past 12 months, India and Japan have also set down spacecraft on the lunar surface. In February, US firm Intuitive Machines became the first private company to put a lander on the Moon, and there are plenty more set to follow. Meanwhile, Nasa wants to send humans back to the Moon, with its Artemis astronauts aiming for a 2026 landing. China says it will send humans to the Moon by 2030. And instead of fleeting visits, the plan is to build permanent bases. But in an age of renewed great-power politics, this new space race could lead to tensions on Earth being exported to the lunar surface. “Our relationship with the Moon is going to fundamentally change very soon,” warns Justin Holcomb, a geologist from the University of Kansas. The rapidity of space exploration is now “outpacing our laws”, he says. Listen to Rebecca read this article on BBC Sounds. A UN agreement from 1967 says no nation can own the Moon. Instead, the fantastically named Outer Space Treaty says it belongs to everyone, and that any exploration has to be carried out for the benefit of all humankind and in the interests of all nations. While it sounds very peaceful and collaborative - and it is - the driving force behind the Outer Space Treaty wasn’t cooperation, but the politics of the Cold War. As tensions grew between the US and Soviet Union after World War Two, the fear was that space could become a military battleground, so the key part of the treaty was that no nuclear weapons could be sent into space. More than 100 nations signed up. But this new space age looks different to the one back then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images An image released by Chinese state media showed a lunar probe carrying the nation's flag\n",
      "\n",
      "One major change is that modern-day Moon missions are not just the projects of nations - companies are competing, too. In January, a US commercial mission called Peregrine announced it was taking human ashes, DNA samples and a sports drink, complete with branding, to the Moon. A fuel leak meant it never made it there, but it sparked debate about how delivering this eclectic inventory fitted in with the treaty’s principle that exploration should benefit all humanity. “We're starting to just send stuff up there just because we can. There's no sort of rhyme or reason anymore,” says Michelle Hanlon, a space lawyer and founder of For All Moonkind, an organisation that seeks to protect the Apollo landing sites. \"Our Moon is within reach and now we're starting to abuse it,” she says. But even if lunar private enterprise is on the increase, nation states still ultimately remain the key players in all this, Sa’id Mosteshar, director of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law, says any company needs to be authorised to go into space by a state, which will be limited by the international treaties. There’s still a great deal of prestige to be had by joining the elite club of Moon landers. After their successful missions, India and Japan could very much claim to be global space players. And a nation with a successful space industry can bring a big boost to the economy through jobs, innovation. But the Moon race offers an even bigger prize: its resources. While the lunar terrain looks rather barren, it contains minerals, including rare earths, metals like iron and titanium - and helium too, which is used in everything from superconductors to medical equipment. Estimates for the value of all this vary wildly, from billions to quadrillions. So it’s easy to see why some see the Moon as a place to make lots of money. However, it’s also important to note that this would be a very long-term investment - and the tech needed to extract and return these lunar resources is a some way off. In 1979, an international treaty declared that no state or organisation could claim to own the resources there. But it wasn’t popular - only 17 countries are party to it, and this does not include any countries who’ve been to the Moon, including the US. In fact, the US passed a law in 2015 allowing its citizens and industries to extract, use and sell any space material. “This caused tremendous consternation amongst the international community,” Michelle Hanlon told me. “But slowly, others followed suit with similar national laws.” These included Luxembourg, the UAE, Japan and India. The resource that could be most in demand is a surprising one: water. “When the first Moon rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts were analysed, they were thought to be completely dry,” explains Sara Russell, professor of planetary sciences at the Natural History Museum. “But then a kind of revolution happened about 10 years ago, and we found out that they’ve got little traces of water in them trapped in phosphate crystals.”\n",

      "Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "And at the Moon’s poles, she says, there’s even more - reserves of water ice are frozen inside permanently shadowed craters. Future visitors could use the water for drinking, it could be used to generate oxygen and astronauts could even use it to make rocket fuel, by splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen, allowing them to travel from the Moon to Mars and beyond. The US is now attempting to establish a new set of guiding principles around lunar exploration - and lunar exploitation. The so-called Artemis Accords state that extracting and using resources on the Moon should be done in a way complies with the Treaty for Outer Space, although it says some new rules might be needed. More than 40 countries have so far signed up to these non-binding agreements, but China is notably absent from the list. And some argue that new rules for lunar exploration shouldn’t be led by an individual nation. “This really ought to be done through the United Nations because it affects all countries,” Sa’id Mosteshar tells me. But access to resources could also cause another clash. While there’s plenty of room on the Moon, areas close to ice-filled craters are the prime lunar real estate. So what happens if everyone wants the same spot for their future base? And once a country has set one up, what’s to stop another nation establishing their base a bit too close? “I think there's an interesting analogy to the Antarctic,” says Jill Stuart, a space policy and law researcher at the London School of Economics. “We'll probably see research bases being set up on the Moon like they are on the continent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But specific decisions about a new lunar base, for example whether it covers a few square kilometres or a few hundred, may come down to whoever gets there first. “There will definitely be a first-mover advantage,” Jill Stuart says. “So if you can get there first and set up camp, then you can work out the size of your zone of exclusion. It doesn’t mean you own that land, but you can sit on that space.” Right now, the first settlers are most likely to be either the US or China, bringing a new layer of rivalry to an already tense relationship. And they are likely to set the standard - the rules established by whoever gets there first may end up being the rules that stick over time. If this all sounds a bit ad hoc, some of the space experts I’ve spoken to think we’re unlikely to see another major international space treaty. The dos and don’ts of lunar exploration are more likely to be figured out with memorandums of understanding or new codes of conduct. There’s a lot at stake. The Moon is our constant companion, as we watch it wax and wane through its various phases as it glows bright in the sky. But as this new space race gets under way, we need to start thinking about what sort of place we want it to be - and whether it risks becoming a setting where very Earthly rivalries are played out.\n",

      "India is no stranger to coalition governments. Some of the world’s largest coalitions, comprising between six and a dozen parties, have been formed in the world's most populous democracy. From 1989 to 2004, six general elections produced no single-party majority. Some of these coalitions have been particularly chaotic: between 1989 and 1999, eight were formed and many quickly collapsed. But some of India’s most significant economic reforms and highest growth rates have come under coalition governments, led by both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Why India's Modi failed to win outright majority Now, for the first time since 2014, India will have a coalition government, with no single-party majority. Narendra Modi of the BJP, set for a third term as prime minister, has seen his majority reduced by a resurgent opposition, and now primarily relies on two allies in his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for a parliamentary majority. But will Mr Modi, who always ruled with a majority as chief minister of Gujarat state and as India’s prime minister, and dominated politics for a decade, be able to run a coalition? Can he shed his domineering style and carry disparate regional allies along? And will he curb a growing personality cult stoked by his party and a friendly media to adopt a more consensual, humbler image?\n",
      "\n",
      "N Chandrababu Naidu/Twitter Nitish Kumar (right) and N Chandrababu Naidu (second from right) have served in BJP-led governments in the past\n",
      "\n",
      "Many believe it's unlikely to be smooth sailing for Mr Modi in a coalition. The two allies that Mr Modi is most dependent on are two regional parties, Janata Dal (United) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP). They have 28 seats between them. Both are led by veteran, astute leaders - Nitish Kumar and N Chandrababu Naidu, respectively - who have previously served in BJP-led federal coalition governments and then quit over differences with the ruling party, specifically over Mr Modi. In 2019, while serving as Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Mr Naidu labeled Mr Modi, then his political rival, a \"terrorist\". Politics makes for strange bedfellows - India is no stranger to that fact. Coalition governments dependent on just two or three allies are particularly vulnerable to collapse if even one withdraws support. Many believe a coalition government under Mr Modi could contribute to a healthier democracy. They say it could reduce the prime minister's dominance, decentralise governance, increase checks and balances, embolden the opposition, and make institutions like the bureaucracy, judiciary and media more independent. Atal Behari Vajpayee, one of the BJP’s stalwarts, ran a successful multi-party coalition government from 1998 to 2004. The avuncular leader privatised state-owned firms, facilitated foreign investment, built expressways, relaxed trade barriers, and even ignited an IT revolution. He ended a decades-old moratorium on nuclear tests, eased tensions with Pakistan and built closer ties with US. Much of this had to do with Mr Vajpayee’s consensual style.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr Modi’s coalition is vastly different from the ones in the past. Despite securing fewer than the 272 seats needed for a majority government, the BJP still took 240 seats, so remains an influential and dominant coalition leader. And in the past, successful minority governments have been run with even less seats. Congress were able to run a successful minority government with 232 seats in 1991- and with just 145 and 206 seats in 2004 and 2009. Furthermore, Mr Modi leads an aggressive and revamped BJP. Amit Shah, his closest confidant, embodies a redefined top leadership that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor characterises as a \"my way or the highway\" approach to governance. In the past, BJP-led coalitions put the party’s key ideological and polarising issues on the backburner to accommodate the demands of their allies. Much of the party's agenda – revoking the autonomy of Kashmir, building the Ram temple – has already been achieved under Mr Modi's leadership. Will his allies now urge him to tone down his divisive rhetoric, particularly against Muslims, which he used freely during the election campaign?\n",
      "\n",
      "N Chandrababu Naidu/Twitter Mr Naidu had called Mr Modi a 'terrorist' when he was a political rival in 2019\n",
      "\n",
      "Effective coalition politics demands collective action to function as a bloc and offer checks and balances. The key question now is what major issues the coalition partners and the BJP can agree upon. Mr Modi’s party has been pushing for a controversial plan to hold simultaneous federal and state elections, something India gave up in 1967. His party has also promised an Uniform Civil Code or UCC, a single personal law for all citizens, irrespective of religion, sex, gender and sexual orientation. This has been resisted in the past by both the country’s majority Hindus and minority Muslims. Then there’s the delicate issue of redrawing of parliamentary boundaries, due after 2026. The wealthier, less populated southern states fear that Mr Modi will expand parliament, with the seat count favouring the poorer, more populous Hindi heartland states - a traditional BJP stronghold. Mr Modi will also have to listen to regional and state-specific demands from the allies and accommodate their leaders' ambitions. Both the TDP and JD(U) have demanded special status for their states, which mean more federal funds. The allies, according to media reports, are also eyeing influential ministries.\n",

      "Getty Images Mr Modi's coalition will face a resurgent opposition led by Rahul Gandhi\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite a rebounding economy fuelled by government spending, Mr Modi needs to create more jobs and boost incomes for the poor and middle class. India’s economy requires many structural reforms in agriculture, land and labour. Mr Modi may need a consultative approach with allies to achieve any of this. For a man used to basking in the spotlight, consensual politics may not come easily to Mr Modi, many believe. \"He has suddenly been asked to enact a role that he has never done before in his life,\" says Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a biographer of the prime minister . But successful politicians master the art of reinvention. Will India now see a humbler, more consultative and consensual Mr Modi? “We will have to wait and see,” says Sandeep Shastri, a political analyst. “We have to view this through the lens of current circumstances, not past alliances.” Watch this space.\n",

      "\n",
      "The United Nations’ refugee agency has warned judges it may have new evidence from 2024 that Rwanda has endangered asylum seekers, despite Parliament passing a law declaring the country is safe. In a highly significant intervention in the continuing legal battle over the policy, the UNHCR told the High Court on Monday that it is investigating new allegations of abuses. Those allegations include individuals potentially being sent to countries where they could be tortured, despite Rishi Sunak arguing, during the same period, that Rwanda was a safe partner for the UK. A judge has granted the UN agency permission to prepare a dossier before a flight of asylum seekers can leave the UK. The court’s decision is a blow to the government because the agency’s intervention was a deciding factor in the Supreme Court finding that the original Rwanda plan was unlawful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home Secretary James Cleverly’s lawyers have told the court that no one will be sent to Rwanda before 24 July. Labour has pledged to scrap the policy if it wins the general election on 4 July. Despite the uncertainty over the future of the scheme, at least a dozen major challenges are now before the courts - most from individual asylum seekers who want to know their future. During the first Rwanda legal battle in 2022 and 2023, the UN’s evidence was critical to judging whether the country could be considered a safe and fair place to send asylum seekers. It showed the British courts evidence of Rwanda subjecting refugees to “refoulement” - the practice of illegally returning an asylum seeker to a country they had fled from, despite knowing they may be tortured.\n",

Lawrence Bottinick, a UN official, told the court in a witness statement that the agency had not seen any improvements. “In particular, UNHCR is aware of repeated incidents of refoulement from Rwanda and denial of access to the asylum procedure to asylum seekers in Rwanda post-dating my earlier statements,” he said. “These incidents have occurred in a variety of contexts and continued into 2024.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Zara Aleena's murderer was recalled to prison late because a probation officer missed an email sent days before her death, an inquest has heard. Sexual predator Jordan McSweeney, who had 28 previous convictions, was at large on 26 June, 2022, when he killed the 35-year-old law graduate in Ilford, east London. He had been released from jail on licence nine days earlier. Devina Ford told East London Coroner's Court she had “unfortunately\" missed the message on 22 June requesting she sign off paperwork to initiate his recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "That meant it was not completed until 24 June. McSweeney was released on 17 June, but did not attend his initial probation appointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "MET POLICE McSweeney was released from prison on licence nine days before he killed Ms Aleena\n",
      "\n",
      "The inquest heard his mother said he was passed out drunk. On 20 June, McSweeney failed to attend a second appointment. His mother said she had not seen him since his release. Previously, the inquest heard newly qualified probation officer, Austin Uwaifo, accept he should have classified McSweeney as high risk instead of medium. This, he said, was an “oversight\". Ms Ford, Mr Uwaifo’s line manager, accepted she should have supervised his work better and apologised. \"I’m not sure exactly what was going on for me that time,” she said. She also recognised McSweeney should have been classified as high risk as early as February 2021 rather than medium risk. Ms Ford told the inquest she had been aware at the time how important her role was in protecting the public and that her work was not up to scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "PC Paul Cozins worked with the integrated offender management team, monitoring persistent offenders. He told the court McSweeney’s case had been discussed at a meeting the day after he missed his second probation appointment. Rajeev Thacker, representing Ms Aleena’s family, asked PC Cozins if alarm bells had been rung by McSweeney’s missed appointments, allegations he had been drinking, and the lack of information about where he was. The officer agreed they had. He did not know whether he had spoken up, he said, as \"not everything is documented”. The inquest heard it was agreed at the meeting that police should visit his mother's and grandmother's homes, but that this did not happen. “It comes down to workload,” PC Cozins said. The inquest continues.\n",

      "\n",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said he will be personally endorsing two DUP candidates in the general election - despite his party's alliance with the rival Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV). He told the Press Association he would be throwing his weight behind Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley. The TUV leader said he found out from the media. Mr Paisley is the DUP candidate in North Antrim, where he will be challenged by TUV leader Jim Allister. Mr Allister said his party entered an electoral arrangement with Reform UK \"in good faith\" and called Mr Farage's move \"disappointing\". Mr Wilson is running in the East Antrim constituency, where the TUV candidate is Matthew Warwick.\n",

      "Getty Images Mr Wilson is running in the East Antrim constituency, where the TUV candidate is Matthew Warwick\n",

      "The TUV announced an electoral alliance with Reform UK in March when Richard Tice was the party leader. Mr Farage replaced him last week. The TUV applied to run its candidates under a joint banner of \"TUV/Reform UK\" on ballot papers, but that was rejected by the Electoral Office so it is running under “TUV no sea border”. Mr Allister said he was \"surprised\" to find out about Mr Farage's endorsement \"when the media reported it\". But he said: “The endorsement that TUV seeks in this election is that of ordinary voters. \"The comments by Mr Farage today are, of course, disappointing and not compatible with the content of a conversation I had with him last week.\" Reform UK said they are \"committed\" to the alliance with the TUV. In a statement, they said: \"Candidates will be standing under our joint logo throughout Northern Ireland. \"Nigel Farage was giving a personal view in respect of two DUP candidates with whom he has worked closely in the past, but he has not changed the policy and does not intend to do so.\" Mr Farage said: \"New leadership brings change. \"I wish the TUV well, but I'm gonna stand up to support Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley as people I fought with all through the Brexit years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The DUP's North Antrim candidate Ian Paisley said Mr Farage's endorsement is not surprising. \"I’ve known Nigel for many years, and indeed in 2019 Nigel endorsed me. He also endorsed Sammy in 2019.\" Mr Paisley also said he is \"surprised Jim thought that he had something that he didn’t have\". \"I think it actually clears up some of the confusion around how Jim maybe oversold what he had,\" he added.\n",

      "Getty Images Douglas Ross said it was not feasible for him to continue in three roles - as MSP, MP and party leader\n",
      "\n",
      "Douglas Ross has announced he will resign as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. He will carry on in the role until after the election and will also resign as an MSP if he is re-elected to Westminster. It follows a row over Mr Ross standing as a candidate for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East instead of David Duguid, who has been in hospital and was in effect de-selected. Mr Ross said he originally thought he could continue to serve as an MSP and MP as well as party leader, but said \"on reflection, that is not feasible\". He was the only MSP to also serve as an MP in the current Holyrood session before the UK Parliament dissolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Duguid, who had held the Banff and Buchan seat since 2017, had already been adopted by local party members and has disputed suggestions that he is \"seriously ill\". On Monday, a Scottish Conservative source told BBC News that Mr Ross had come to the realisation that the party's MSPs would not \"put up\" with him serving as both an MP and an MSP. They added that the reaction to him announcing plans to stand in place of Mr Duguid was another factor. The seat has recently been redrawn as Aberdeenshire North and Moray East. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Ross said colleagues had told him over the weekend they were \"uncomfortable\" with his decision to stand. He said he had to make the choice \"overnight\" and that the party management board had made \"difficult decisions\" on no longer having Mr Duguid in the running.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ross: Colleagues uncomfortable with me standing as MP\n",
      "\n",
      "He said: \"I was delighted and honoured to get the support of local members to be their candidate. \"But I also recognise in the three years that I’ve been party leader, MP and MSP have been different circumstances and that’s why I want to give the commitment to the people of Aberdeenshire North and Moray East that if they elect me as their local representative they will be my number one priority and they will have my full focus.\" Pressed on whether he had mishandled the situation, Mr Ross said \"everything can be done differently with hindsight\", adding: \"I’m resigning as party leader, I think that’s quite a clear indication that I have taken a decision that I think is right in these circumstances.\" Mr Ross also came under pressure at the weekend when the Sunday Mail reported that his own advisers had raised concerns over 28 parliamentary travel claims which may have been combined with his work as a football linesman. He said the expenses claims were approved by the independent parliamentary body IPSA and he would have \"no issue\" with the expenses being examined for a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "SNS Mr Ross pictured as assistant referee during a match between Hearts and Partick Thistle in August last year\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had enjoyed working with Mr Ross, but respected his decision to step down. He said: \"He’s been a steadfast champion for the union but also he and I have worked together on delivering two freeports for Scotland attracting jobs and investment, standing up to the SNP’s misguided gender recognition reforms and also being unashamedly champions of Scotland’s north sea energy industry – the only party to consistently have done that. \"I think that’s a track record that Douglas can be proud of.\" In 2016, Mr Ross became the MSP for Highlands and Islands via the list system. Following the unexpected resignation of Jackson Carlaw, he quickly became the leader of the Scottish Conservatives in August 2020. Mr Carlaw said that a \"younger and fresher voice\" was needed to lead the party into the next Scottish Parliament election. At the time Mr Ross was seen as a close ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who spoke to him shortly after he was confirmed as leader - despite opposing Brexit in the EU referendum. However he was also at times critical of Boris Johnson's leadership. Before leading the Scottish Conservatives, he had resigned as a Scotland Office minister when the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings refused to quit for making a trip from London to Durham during lockdown. In January 2022, Mr Ross withdrew his support for Boris Johnson saying his position had become \"untenable\" over lockdown parties, and he called for a no-confidence vote. He then reversed that position when the war in Ukraine started, arguing that political upheaval at home would play into the hands of Vladimir Putin. In a double U-turn, Mr Ross later voted for the motion of no confidence in Mr Johnson's leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a party leader announces their resignation in the middle of an election campaign, you know something has gone very wrong. For Douglas Ross, it was replacing the hospitalised David Duguid as his party’s candidate in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East at the general election. Some were uneasy about the optics of the party leader swooping in when a colleague was ill. But what had gone down really badly with Conservative MSPs at Holyrood was the plan to continue to try and carry on as both an MP and an MSP. Douglas Ross had previously promised he wouldn’t do that. One of his Scottish Tory colleagues told me last week it had been received \"like a bucket of cold sick\". So Mr Ross will leave Holyrood if re-elected to Westminster. Some of his colleagues feel that's where his heart has always really been. Pressure piled up on him over the weekend and may well have intensified with the newspaper story about his expenses. His decision will impact on the UK-wide campaign too. Rishi Sunak won’t have factored in his Scottish leader calling it a day in the run-up to polling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final list of candidates for the Aberdeenshire North and Moray East constituency was published on Friday. Ian Bailey is standing for the Liberal Democrats, Andy Brown for Labour, Jo Hart for Reform UK, Seamus Logan for the SNP and Douglas Ross for the Conservatives. Following Mr Ross's announcement, SNP leader John Swinney accused him of taking voters for granted and treating them with \"contempt\". He said: \"He wants to have it on his terms. \"Well, when you're in politics, you're in it on the terms of the electorate. We all accept that. It's the electorate that decides.\" Alba leader Alex Salmond said it was the \"first case of a rat deserting a sinking ship while simultaneously trying to clamber aboard a gravy train\". He called on him to resign as a candidate for the Westminster seat, adding that Mr Ross was \"totally devoid of honour\". Scottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie wished Mr Ross luck in the future, reserving her criticism for the Conservative party and UK government. She said: \"Voters know that this rotten Tory government has nothing to offer Scotland – it’s no wonder Douglas Ross has given up on trying to resuscitate the Scottish Tories’ flailing campaign.\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said the move was proof the party was in \"abject disarray\". “Just like the SNP, the Tories have been in power for too long, breaking rules and taking you for granted,\" he said. And Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, told BBC News it has \"never been clear\" what Mr Ross' focus was between working as an MSP, an MP and a football linesman. She said: “I think its clear that the Tory party, UK-wide including in Scotland is toast. They’re on their way out so whoever takes on that role for the Scottish Tories, it’s going to be a pretty thankless task.”\n",

      "\n",
      "A new housing development in a seaside town has been compared to a prison by locals who say it has also been built too close to their homes. A total of 90 temporary homes have been constructed on the site of a former school in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan. The Vale council says it is for Ukrainian refugees and the site was allocated for housing in the local development plan (LDP), but residents with gardens backing on to it call it “overbearing”. The council used permitted development rights in January 2023, meaning it did not have to seek further planning permission on the former Eagleswell Primary School site.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It looks like I’m living next door to a storage container yard,\" said Steve McGranaghan, a retired RAF engineer. \"My biggest concern is they are too close to me. They should be 21 metres (69ft) away under planning guidelines and they're less than 10 metres (33ft) away. “If they'd built 72 houses which is in the LDP, I'd have no issue. \"I’m not someone who says 'not in my back yard'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "bbc Steve McGranaghan says the development has been built too close to his home\n",
      "\n",
      "He claimed they would no longer be used for Ukrainian refugees. “Nobody has been able to challenge this,\" he said. “I volunteered to host a Ukrainian family, so we didn't have an issue at first. “Now our concern is this won't be for housing Ukrainians, and it'll become housing stock and won't be temporary. “If there was a bad way to do something the Vale of Glamorgan council have chosen the worst possible way to do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave Thomas “It looks like a prison, and it feels like a prison” says Dave Thomas, from the action group.\n",
      "\n",
      "The council's planning committee was expected to consider the application for the site next month, but it was delayed until July due to9 the general election. Residents opposing the development set up an action group and raised more than £7,000 in days to secure legal support. “It looks like a prison, and it feels like a prison,” said Dave Thomas, 61, from the action group. Mr Thomas, who has lived on Pembroke Place, next to the site, for 29 years with his family, said: “How can planning make a fair decision now, it feels pre-determined as they've already spent £25m on this. “They are not going to take them away after spending that much money on them.” “We thought it was going to help people fleeing their country and would be temporary.” “It looks like a prison, and it feels like a prison. And yet it was meant to be a welcoming place for refugees.” “It's the least welcoming place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave Thomas says the development is \"overbearing\" with the homes looking into his garden\n",
      "\n",
      "The council said the units were temporary for five years and they could be easily removed and reused. A council spokesperson said: “Development of the site commenced on 3 June 2023 and permitted development rights would be applicable for twelve months from this date. After this the development would be considered 'unauthorised.\" It said it was \"tandard procedure in these circumstances is to wait for the outcome of the planning application before deciding next steps\". The council said it was \"only right that in circumstances such as this elected members have the benefit of a comprehensive and detailed report with references to all material considerations and the views and opinions of adjoining residents before reaching a decision. “No families will move into the temporary homes until a decision has been made, and then only if planning approval is granted.”\n",
